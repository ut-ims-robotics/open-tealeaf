# ABOUT THE PROJECT

The purpose of the “OPEN-TeaLeaF” project is to design portable and open teaching and learning kits (TeaLeaF kits). The kits make expensive equipment accessible to learners and promote hands-on learning experiences. By promoting time-sharing of robotic equipment, hundreds of pupils in Estonia and Austria can be engaged with a relatively conservative number of physical devices. “OPEN-TeaLeaF” conducts teacher workshops to ensure the didactic foundation empowers teachers to use the kits in their classes.

The main focus of the actvity is to demonstrate that STEAM skills relevant for professional development can be acquired through socially-driven education without requiring costly investments. For that reason, the outcomes of the actvity continue to reach teachers and pupils beyond the end date much the same way as during the actvity. Also, by sharing the experience, bill of materials for TeaLeaF units, and the learning content, we expect a multiplier effect. As the essence of TeaLeaF units is a combintion of open-source hardware and low-cost off-the-shelf devices, the legacy of the project is a community-based opensource movement. Other countries and institutions can follow the lead by reproducing the TeaLeaF units, localizing the learning paths, developing new learning journeys and setting up mechanisms for reaching target audiences. In order to achieve this momentum with the proposed activity, the Disseminatin Plan will include a strategy for continued community building.

The overall work plan consists of the following work packages:

WP1 Management & Dissemination (Leader: University of Tartu)
WP2 TeaLeaf units development (Leader: University of Tartu)
WP3 Development and Delivery of Teacher trainings (Leader: OCG)
WP4 Piloting, Quality Assurance and Mass Deployment (Leader: Joanneum)
The project is lead by University of Tartu (Estonia) and the partners are OCG Austria Computer Society (Austria) and Joanneum Research.



# PARTNERS

## University of Tartu – leading partner

UT includes four faculties. To support and develop the professional competence of its students and academic staff, the university has entered into bilateral co-operation agreements with 79 partner institutions in 31 countries.

University of Tartu (UT) is Estonia’s leading centre of research and training. It preserves the culture of the Estonian people and spearheads the country’s reputation in research and provision of higher education. UT belongs to the top 1.2% of world’s best universities.

As Estonia’s national university, UT stresses the importance of international co-operation and partnerships with reputable research universities all over the world. The robust research potential of the university is evidenced by the fact that the University of Tartu has been invited to join the Coimbra Group, a prestigious club of renowned research universities.

UT includes four faculties. To support and develop the professional competence of its students and academic staff, the university has entered into bilateral co-operation agreements with 79 partner institutions in 31 countries.

## OCG Austria Computer Society

The Austrian Computer Society (OCG) is a non-profit association for the promotion of information technology with due regard to the interaction with people and society. The association acts as an interdisciplinary forum for the latest IT topics, it is an important and respected dialogue partner and has thematic leadership for socio-political IT topics.

The OCG acts as a networking forum, it is a competent and reliable partner for event organisation and that way promotes the relationship between science and business. Moreover, it offers standardised, independent and high-quality IT education and training thus building an important bridge to the working world.

## JOANNEUM RESEARCH

JOANNEUM RESEARCH, headquartered in Graz, is a successful national and internationally active research institution owned by the Austrian federal states of Styria, Carinthia and Burgenland. Ideally embedded in the national and international innovation network, our researchers innovate in three high-level fields of expertise: “[Information and Production Technologies](https://www.joanneum.at/en/informations-und-produktionstechnologien)”, “[Human Technologies and Medicine](https://www.joanneum.at/en/humantechnologie-und-medizin)”, and “[Society and Sustainability](https://www.joanneum.at/en/gesellschaft-und-nachhaltigkeit)”. They use ideas, innovative power and considerable research experience to support companies both private and public not only with the development of technology, methods and products, but also with societal topics.

# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## Learning kit contents

The learning kit consists of the following components:

- ROBOTONT, an open-source mobile robot for education and research
- Game controller for teleoperating the robot
- Batteries for the robot
- Charger for the robot’s battery
- Power supply cable
- USB memory stick that contains the pre-installed software
- Markers for enabling vision-based perception
- Small traffic cones for marking the area of application

To ensure the scalability of OPEN-TeaLeaF kits, the components are either completely open-sourced (preferred) or low-cost off-the-shelf products with many functional alternatives.
The specific brand or a model for component that is included in an OPEN-TeaLeaF kits is not necessarily strictly defined as long as the intended functionality is still maintained. For that reason, there are minor differences in the Bill of Materials for kits created in Austria (version AT) and Estonia (version ET). The table below provides an overview of the TeaLeaF kit final BoM and possible variations.
