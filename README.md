# ABOUT THE PROJECT

The purpose of the “OPEN-TeaLeaF” project is to design portable and open teaching and learning kits (TeaLeaF kits). The kits make expensive equipment accessible to learners and promote hands-on learning experiences. By promoting time-sharing of robotic equipment, hundreds of pupils in Estonia and Austria can be engaged with a relatively conservative number of physical devices. “OPEN-TeaLeaF” conducts teacher workshops to ensure the didactic foundation empowers teachers to use the kits in their classes.

The OPEN-TeaLeaF activity is supported by EIT Manufacturing co-funded by the European Union.

## Learning kit contents

| OPEN-TeaLeaF kits (Type-EE) | OPEN-TeaLeaF kits (Type-AT) |

The learning kit consists of the following components:

- ROBOTONT, an open-source mobile robot for education and research
- Game controller for teleoperating the robot
- Batteries for the robot
- Charger for the robot’s battery
- Power supply cable
- USB memory stick that contains the pre-installed software
- Markers for enabling vision-based perception
- Small traffic cones for marking the area of application

To ensure the scalability of OPEN-TeaLeaF kits, the components are either completely open-sourced (preferred) or low-cost off-the-shelf products with many functional alternatives.
The specific brand or a model for component that is included in an OPEN-TeaLeaF kits is not necessarily strictly defined as long as the intended functionality is still maintained. For that reason, there are minor differences in the Bill of Materials for kits created in Austria (Type-AT) and Estonia (Type-EE). The table below provides an overview of the TeaLeaF kit final BoM and possible variations.
